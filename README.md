# Consumer Behavior – Utility Analysis Tool

This repository contains a simple educational software application designed to demonstrate key concepts of consumer behavior and utility analysis in microeconomics.

The application allows users to:

- Define prices and a budget
- Input total utility values for multiple goods

- Automatically compute marginal utility

- Visualize total utility and marginal utility through graphs

- Determine the optimal consumption combination based on the Equi-Marginal Principle

#### Purpose
The main goal of this project is to bridge economic theory and practical visualization, making abstract concepts like diminishing marginal utility and utility maximization easier to understand through hands-on interaction.
